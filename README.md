# SCAMP-FINAL-PROJECT-INDI
This my individual scamp final project

In this project, I clean and build models using the cars dataset.
Cleaning : I use different methods to clean the categorical and numeric variables as much as possible.
Modelling: In this stage, the problem is defined as a classification and regression problem.
          We use different models on the dataset, predict on the test set and then evaluate those models using the right metrics
          
Technical article: In this article, I describe the process taken to clean and model the used car dataset.

SCAMP reflection: Also, I wrote an article on my best lessons from the SCAMP program.
