# SCAMP-FINAL-PROJECT-INDI
This my individual scamp final project

In this project, I clean and build models using the cars dataset.
Cleaning : I use different methods to clean the categorical and numeric variables as much as possible.
Visualization: At the end of the cleaning exercise, the main variables are visualized to check for relationships and
               trends between the variables.
Modelling: In this stage, I use different models on the dataset, test and then evaluate those models
